# If START.bat Still Closes Immediately

## Try This First:

1. **Extract the NEW .zip file**
   - Delete the old extracted folder
   - Extract BBK-Desktop-App-v1.0.0.zip again
   - Make sure you're using the latest version

2. **Run TEST-WINDOW.bat**
   - This simple test checks if batch files work
   - If TEST-WINDOW.bat ALSO closes immediately:
     - Problem is with your system, not the batch file
     - Continue to "System-Level Fixes" below

3. **Run CHECK-SYSTEM.bat**
   - Checks for Node.js, npm, files
   - If this closes immediately too:
     - Your system has batch file execution issues

## System-Level Fixes:

### Fix 1: Run from Command Prompt
Instead of double-clicking, try:
```cmd
1. Press Win+R
2. Type: cmd
3. Press Enter
4. Type: cd C:\BBK-Desktop-App (your extracted folder path)
5. Type: START.bat
6. Press Enter
```
Window should stay open this way.

### Fix 2: Create Desktop Shortcut
```cmd
1. Right-click START.bat
2. Send to → Desktop (create shortcut)
3. Right-click the shortcut → Properties
4. Change "Run:" to "Normal window" (not Minimized)
5. Click OK
6. Double-click the shortcut
```

### Fix 3: Check Windows Settings
```
Settings → Privacy & Security → For developers
→ Enable "Change execution policy..."
```

### Fix 4: Disable "Quick Edit Mode"
```
1. Open Command Prompt
2. Right-click title bar → Properties
3. Uncheck "Quick Edit Mode"
4. Click OK
```

## Manual Start (Workaround):

If START.bat won't work, run manually:

```cmd
1. Open Command Prompt (cmd)
2. Navigate to folder:
   cd C:\BBK-Desktop-App

3. Start Python Bridge:
   start python-bridge\BBK-Bridge.exe

4. Wait 3 seconds

5. Start Electron:
   npm start
```

## Check What's Actually Happening:

Run this to see errors:
```cmd
START.bat > output.log 2>&1
notepad output.log
```

This saves all output to a file you can read.

## If npm start Fails:

1. **Check Node.js:**
   ```cmd
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```
   If "command not found" → Install Node.js

2. **Install dependencies manually:**
   ```cmd
   cd C:\BBK-Desktop-App
   npm install
   ```

3. **Try starting again:**
   ```cmd
   npm start
   ```

## Common Error Messages:

**"'node' is not recognized"**
→ Node.js not installed or not in PATH
→ Install from https://nodejs.org/
→ Restart computer after installing

**"Cannot find module 'electron'"**
→ Dependencies not installed
→ Run: npm install

**"Error: listen EADDRINUSE :::8000"**
→ Port 8000 already in use
→ Close BBK-Bridge.exe in Task Manager
→ Try again

**"ENOENT: no such file or directory"**
→ Running from wrong folder
→ cd to the correct BBK-Desktop-App folder

## Still Not Working?

Try the **BBK-Complete-Package** instead:
- Located at: E:\githubNew\bbk\bbk-desktop-app\BBK-Complete-Package\
- Use START-APP.bat from that folder
- It has better error handling

Or check if there's a standalone .exe version available (no Node.js needed).

---

**Quick Test:**
```cmd
1. Open cmd
2. cd to BBK-Desktop-App folder
3. Type: echo test
4. Type: pause
```
If this works but START.bat doesn't, the batch file has an issue.
